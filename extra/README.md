## Auxiliary Tools

This folder contains auxiliary tools used to enhance the compatibility and/or interaction of MonsterMod with other mods. 

As these are auxiliary, they aren't needed to enjoy MonsterMod. If you want an extra boost, feel free to install these.

Once all milestones are completed, the possibility of removing the need for external plugins will be considered. Until then, this has to stay.
